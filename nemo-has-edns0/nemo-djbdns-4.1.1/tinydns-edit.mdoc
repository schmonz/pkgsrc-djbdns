.Sh NAME
.Nm tinydns-edit
.Nd edit the (source form of the) database served by tinydns/axfrdns
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tinydns-edit
.Ar data
.Ar data.tmp
add
.Ar type
.Ar name
.Ar address
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm tinydns-edit
edits the
.Ar data
file, which is the source form of the database that is compiled by
.Xr tinydns-data 8
and that is served by
.Xr tinydns 8
and
.Xr axfrdns 8 .
The update to
.Ar data
is performed atomically, by first writing the updated database content to the file
.Ar data.tmp
and then renaming
.Ar data.tmp
to
.Ar data .
The two files must, of course, reside on the same volume in order that this can be achieved.
.Pp
On success,
.Nm tinydns-edit
returns zero.
If, for any reason, an error occurs it will exit with a non-zero code and
.Ar data
will not be changed.
.Pp
With the "add" verb,
.Nm tinydns-edit
appends to the database a record whose type is determined by
.Ar type ,
with the fully-qualified name
.Ar name
and the IP address
.Ar address .
.Ar type
can be one of:
.Bl -tag
.It ns
A
.Sq \.
record is created.
This record specifies that the domain
.Ar name
is published by a DNS content server that is listening on the IP address
.Ar address .
The name of the DNS content server is not directly specifiable.
Names are automatically assigned by
.Nm tinydns-edit
itself, following the pattern
.Ar Li [a-z].ns. Ns Ar name .
.Nm tinydns-edit
will assign the first letter of the alphabet that is not already used in another
.Sq \.
or
.Sq &
record as the name of a DNS content server.
If no letters of the alphabet remain unused,
.Nm tinydns-edit
will fail.
If a
.Sq ..
or
.Sq &
record for the domain already exists, proxy DNS servers are allowed to cache the new record for the same length of time as they are allowed to cache the existing records.
Otherwise, proxy DNS servers are allowed to cache the record for up to 3 days.
.It childns
A
.Sq &
record is created.
This record specifies that queries for names in the domain
.Ar name
should be referred to a
.Dq ( child )
DNS content server that is listening on the IP address
.Ar address .
The name of the DNS content server is not directly specifiable.
Names are automatically assigned by
.Nm tinydns-edit
itself, following the pattern
.Ar Li [a-z].ns. Ns Ar name .
.Nm tinydns-edit
will assign the first letter of the alphabet that is not already used in another
.Sq \.
or
.Sq &
record as the name of a DNS content server.
If no letters of the alphabet remain unused,
.Nm tinydns-edit
will fail.
If a
.Sq \.
or
.Sq &
record for the domain already exists, proxy DNS servers are allowed to cache the new record for the same length of time as they are allowed to cache the existing records.
Otherwise, proxy DNS servers are allowed to cache the record for up to 3 days.
.It mx
A
.Sq @
record is created.
This record specifies that mail to names in the domain
.Ar name
should be sent to an SMTP server that is listening on the IP address
.Ar address .
The name of the SMTP server is not directly specifiable.
Names are automatically assigned by
.Nm tinydns-edit
itself, following the pattern
.Ar Li [a-z].mx. Ns Ar name .
.Nm tinydns-edit
will assign the first letter of the alphabet that is not already used in another
.Sq @
record as the name of an SMTP server.
If no letters of the alphabet remain unused,
.Nm tinydns-edit
will fail.
It is not possible to specify the
.Em distance
value for the SMTP server.
.Nm tinydns-edit
will leave that field blank, meaning that
.Xr tinydns-data 8
will use whatever the default value is.
If a
.Sq @
record for the domain already exists, proxy DNS servers are allowed to cache the new record for the same length of time as they are allowed to cache the existing records.
Otherwise, proxy DNS servers are allowed to cache the record for up to 1 day.
.It host
A
.Sq =
record is created, that proxy DNS servers are allowed to cache for up to 1 day.
This record specifies that the name
.Ar name
maps to the IP address
.Ar address
and vice versa.
.Nm tinydns-edit
will fail if a
.Sq =
record already exists that uses either
.Ar name
or
.Ar address .
.It alias
A
.Sq +
record is created, that proxy DNS servers are allowed to cache for up to 1 day.
This record specifies that the name
.Ar name
maps to the IP address
.Ar address
but that there is no reverse mapping.
Because this is an alias record,
.Nm tinydns-edit
will not fail if there happen to already be existing records that use
.Ar address .
