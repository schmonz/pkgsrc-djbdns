.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm walldns6
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm walldns6
is a reverse DNS wall.
It accepts iterative DNS queries for
.Ad in-addr.arpa
domains from hosts around the Internet, and supplies generic responses that avoid revealing local host information.
.Pp
For example,
.Nm walldns6
provides a PTR record for
.Ad 4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa
showing
.Ad 4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa
as the name of IP address
.Ad 1.2.3.4 ,
and a matching A record showing
.Ad 1.2.3.4
as the IP address of
.Ad 4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa .
.Sh "CONFIGURATION"
Normally
.Nm walldns6
is set up by the
.Xr walldns6-conf 8
program.
.Pp
.Nm walldns6
runs chrooted in the directory specified by the
.Ev $ROOT
environment variable, under the uid and gid specified by the
.Ev $UID
and
.Ev $GID
environment variables.
.Pp
.Nm walldns6
listens for incoming UDP packets addressed to port 53 of
.Ev $IP .
It does not listen for TCP queries.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
.Nm walldns6
rejects inverse queries, non-Internet-class queries, truncated packets, packets that contain anything other than a single question, queries for domains outside
.Ad ip6.arpa ,
and request types other than AAAA, PTR, and *.
.Pp
.Nm walldns6
does not include NS or SOA records with its responses.
.Pp
.Nm walldns6
uses TTLs slightly over one week.
