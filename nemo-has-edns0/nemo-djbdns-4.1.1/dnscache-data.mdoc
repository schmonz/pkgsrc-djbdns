.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm dnscache-data
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm dnscache-data
reads an domain name list from a file named
.Pa data
in the current directory.
It creates
.Pa data.cdb
in a binary format designed for fast access by
.Xr dnscache 8 .
It may also create some other files with names beginning with
.Pa data .
.Pp
.Nm dnscache-data
updates
.Pa data.cdb
atomically, so you can use it safely while
.Xr dnscache 8
is running.
If anything goes wrong with the creation of
.Pa data.cdb ,
.Nm dnscache-data
stops and leaves the old
.Pa data.cdb
in place.
